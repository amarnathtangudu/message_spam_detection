# Urgency Classifier

This project contains an urgency classification model that loads a trained classifier from a pickle file to classify messages as either "Urgent" or "Non-Urgent." The code uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and `scikit-learn` to make predictions based on the contents of a message.

## Files in This Project

- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python libraries required to run the code.
- `urgency.py`: Python script that loads the classifier and vectorizer, makes predictions on a sample message, and prints the result.
- `urgency_classifier_model.pkl`: Pickle file containing the pre-trained classifier and vectorizer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.7 or newer is recommended).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files directly.

2. Open a terminal in the project directory.

3. Install the required libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Code

1. Open `urgency.py` and locate the `test_message` variable:

   ```python
   test_message = "Final notice: Complete the survey within 24 hours."
   ```

   You can change the value of `test_message` to test different messages.

2. Save the changes to `urgency.py` if you modified the `test_message`.

3. Run the script in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python urgency.py
   ```

4. The script will output the message and its predicted urgency label, for example:

   ```plaintext
   Test message: Final notice: Complete the survey within 24 hours.
   Predicted label: Urgent
   ```

## Modifying the Test Message

To test different messages, open `urgency.py`, change the `test_message` variable to your desired text, save the file, and run the script again.

## Additional Notes

- The model uses `TfidfVectorizer` and `LogisticRegression` from `scikit-learn` for text vectorization and classification.
- You can extend this project by integrating more test messages, further training the model, or adapting it to other types of text classification tasks.
